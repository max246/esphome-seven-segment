# Esphome Seven Segment component
This is a custom component to control two segment display from Sparkun that uses TPIC6C596 chip.  [Chip](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13279)  - [Segment](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8530)


I have setup a publish action to the expose text string on my HA, it could be more efficient but for my case it worked fine.
